Heteroresistance to vancomycin among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic problem in clinical microbiology. In 
this prospective cohort study of 842 adult patients with MRSA bacteremia in 
S. Korea, we investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical implications 
of the heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) phenotype. The 
hVISA phenotype is detected in 22% of cases. Multivariable regression analysis 
reveals strong positive associations between hVISA and hospital-acquired 
infection, prior anti-MRSA therapy, vancomycin exposure, and particularly 
vancomycin MIC (odds ratio 15.2 per 1 mg/L increase, p < 0.001). Strikingly, 
patients infected with hVISA strains have a lower 90-day mortality compared to 
those with fully susceptible strains (hazard ratio 0.66, p = 0.019), suggesting 
a possible trade-off between resistance and virulence. However, in hVISA strains 
treated with vancomycin, outcomes reverse: mortality more than doubled (HR 2.5, 
p < 0.001), bacteremia persisted longer, and relapse rates increased fivefold. 
Using maximally selected rank statistics, we identify a PAP-AUC threshold of 
0.65 as the first clinically derived breakpoint predictive of mortality risk, 
providing an actionable definition of vancomycin heteroresistance. These 
findings underscore the clinical relevance of hVISA, and support routine testing 
for heteroresistance to inform treatment decisions.

Enhancing treatment outcomes for drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major global 
priority for tuberculosis control programs. India has the highest number of 
Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis cases worldwide, yet no longitudinal studies 
have assessed the factors affecting treatment outcomes in public sector 
conditions. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with ineffective 
treatment outcomes in patients with Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis receiving 
outpatient care under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme in 
Puducherry, India, from January 2020 to December 2023. We employed multivariate 
regression methods to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to 
identify factors linked to unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Clinical data from 
patients with Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis revealed an overall treatment 
success rate of 60.42%. The findings showed that patients undergoing retreatment 
were more likely to experience unsuccessful outcomes. Additionally, co-infection 
with HIV, as well as the use of alcohol or tobacco, increased the odds of 
treatment failure. Patients with heteroresistant patterns had 2.72 times higher 
odds of unsuccessful treatment outcomes compared to those with inferred and 
true-resistant patterns. Furthermore, patients living in rural areas typically 
experienced worse treatment outcomes than those in urban areas, with higher 
rates of loss to follow-up. Patients on longer treatment regimens were also more 
likely to be lost to follow-up compared to those on shorter regimens. Notably, 
true resistance due to rpoB gene mutations accounted for 65.9% (29 out of 44) of 
total deaths, with mutations at codon S450L contributing to 47.7% of these 
fatalities, a finding that has not been reported elsewhere. The study 
highlighted a strong association between heteroresistance in the rpoB gene and 
poor treatment outcomes. These results emphasize the need for detailed 
molecular-level studies to improve treatment outcomes by ensuring appropriate 
drug selection for MDR/RR Tuberculosis. Additionally, further research is 
necessary to determine the impact of heteroresistance on treatment outcomes in 
individual patients.

Heteroresistance of bacteria refers to the presence of bacterial subgroups with 
different antibiotic sensitivity in the same strain, affecting the bacterial 
eradication effect. In recent years, heteroresistance has posed significant 
challenges to H. pylori eradication failure, while little is known about 
heteroresistance to H. pylori. Facing the current growing heteroresistance and 
declining eradication rates of H. pylori, it is necessary to comprehensively 
understand the epidemiology of heteroresistance as well as detection methods, 
and elucidate the relevant resistance mechanisms to find a more ideal precision 
treatment. In this study, we systematically review the current studies of H. 
pylori heteroresistance and summarize the detection methods and possible 
heteroresistance mechanisms. In brief, it is highly significant to further 
strengthen the general understanding for H. pylori heteroresistance. 
Accordingly, it is necessary to conduct extensive clinical studies on the 
incidence of H. pylori heteroresistance and to refine the clinical definition of 
H. pylori heteroresistance. The development of accurate and standardized 
detection technology is the key to heteroresistance diagnosis. In addition, we 
strongly advocate to further study the heteroresistance mechanism of H. pylori 
in vivo and in vitro, which will advance the development of more effective 
treatment strategies and facilitate the refinement of clinical guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Temocillin is a narrow spectrum β-lactam active against MDR 
Enterobacterales. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to temocillin are poorly 
understood. We analysed resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of 
Escherichia coli and evaluated their impact on temocillin efficacy in vitro and 
in a murine peritonitis model.
METHODS: Two sets of isogenic clinical E. coli strains were studied: a 
susceptible isolate (MLTEM16S) and its resistant derivative, MLTEM16R (mutation 
in nmpC porin gene); and temocillin-resistant derivatives of E. coli CFT073: 
CFT-ΔnmpC (nmpC deletion), CFTbaeS-TP and CFTbaeS-AP (two different mutations in 
the baeS efflux-pump gene).Fitness cost, time-kill curves and phenotypic 
expression of resistance were determined. Temocillin efficacy was assessed in a 
murine peritonitis model.
RESULTS: MICs of temocillin were 16 and 64 mg/L for MLTEM16S and MLTEM16R, 
respectively, and 8, 128, 256 and 256 mg/L for E. coli-CFT073, CFT-ΔnmpC, 
CFTbaeS-TP and CFTbaeS-AP, respectively. No fitness cost of resistance was 
evidenced. All resistant strains showed heteroresistant profiles, except for 
CFTbaeS-AP, which displayed a homogeneous pattern. In vitro, temocillin was 
bactericidal against MLTEM16R, CFT-ΔnmpC, CFTbaeS-TP and CFTbaeS-AP at 128, 256, 
512 and 512 mg/L, respectively. In vivo, temocillin was as effective as 
cefotaxime against MLTEM16R, CFT-ΔnmpC and CFTbaeS-TP, but inefficient against 
CFTbaeS-AP (100% mortality).
CONCLUSIONS: Heteroresistant NmpC porin alteration and active efflux 
modification do not influence temocillin efficacy despite high MIC values, 
unfavourable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic conditions and the absence of 
fitness cost, whereas homogeneously expressed BaeS efflux pump alteration 
yielding similar MICs leads to temocillin inefficacy. MIC as sole predictor of 
temocillin efficacy should be used with caution.

PURPOSE: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are Gram-positive organisms 
that are a known component of normal skin flora and the most common cause of 
nosocomial bacteremia. For CoNS species, the vancomycin MIC breakpoint for 
susceptibility set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute is ≤4 
µg/mL. There has been published reports of vancomycin heteroresistance in CoNS 
with vancomycin MICs of 2 to 4 µg/mL. The aim of this retrospective cohort 
analysis was to assess the clinical impact of vancomycin MICs <2 µg/mL versus ≥2 
µg/mL in adult patients with CoNS bloodstream infections.
METHODS: Adult patients admitted to University Medical Center New Orleans with a 
blood culture positive for CoNS were assessed. The primary outcome was 
difference in 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital, all-cause 
mortality; duration of bacteremia; hospital length of stay; and percentage of 
oxacillin-resistant CoNS.
FINDINGS: There was no difference in mortality in the vancomycin MIC <2 µg/mL 
group versus the vancomycin MIC ≥2 µg/mL group at 30 days (15.4% vs 17.4%; P = 
1). In-hospital, all-cause mortality was also not different between groups 
(11.5% vs 13%; P = 1). Hospital length of stay between groups was 28.2 days 
versus 21 days (P = 0.692). Median duration of bacteremia was 1 day in both 
groups (P = 0.975), and median scheduled duration of antibiotic therapy was 14.9 
days and 19.5 days (P = 0.385). The source and mode of acquisition of CoNS were 
similar between groups. Of all CoNS isolates, 58.7% (44 of 75) were oxacillin 
resistant. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common CoNS species at 66.7% 
(50 of 75). Of all isolates, 30.7% (23 of 75) had a vancomycin MIC ≥2 µg/mL, and 
87% (20 of 23) of these were S. epidermidis. There was a higher percentage of S. 
epidermidis in the vancomycin MIC ≥2 µg/mL group than in the MIC <2 µg/mL group 
(87% vs 57.7%; P = 0.012). CoNS with a vancomycin MIC ≥2 µg/mL were also more 
likely to be oxacillin resistant (78.3% vs 50%; P = 0.005).
IMPLICATIONS: There was no difference in clinical outcomes in adult patients 
with a CoNS bloodstream infection with a vancomycin MIC <2 µg/mL versus ≥2 
µg/mL. At present, vancomycin remains appropriate empiric therapy for CoNS 
bloodstream infection. Further research is needed to determine if there is a 
true clinical impact of a vancomycin MIC ≥2 µg/mL in CoNS infections.

Helicobacter pylori is the most prevalent chronic bacterial infection, with 
approximately half of the world's population estimated to be colonized. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) has classified Helicobacter pylori as a class-I 
carcinogen. All main society guidelines recommend its eradication in infected 
individuals. The global trend indicates that eradication rates are decreasing 
annually and the likelihood of eradication decreases with each unsuccessful 
therapeutic attempt. Resistance to antibiotics in H. pylori strains is the 
leading cause for eradication failure. Still, drug resistance and treatment 
failure may be complex, multi-dimensional and associated with several other 
factors. Knowledge of these factors can aid in optimizing eradication rates. 
This review will focus on the factors associated with refractory H. pylori, with 
a particular emphasis on antibiotic resistance mechanisms and their clinical 
implications. Also, the most recent literature and recommendations available for 
determining an appropriate regimen after the failure of the first attempt at 
eradication will be discussed.

BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics are among the most potent 
second-line antitubercular drugs these days. The aim of the study was to analyze 
the frequency and pattern of genetic mutation in preextensive (pre-XDR) and 
extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using second-line line 
probe assay (LPA) and to compare drug-resistant mutations with different 
treatment outcomes.
METHODS: Sputum, lymph node aspirate, and cold accesses from patients with 
rifampicin-resistant Tuberculosis (TB) were subjected to first-line and 
second-line LPA (Genotype MTBDRsl by Hain Life Science, Germany) to assess 
additional drug resistance to fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin and moxifloxacin). 
Final treatment outcomes as per the National TB Elimination Program were 
assessed and compared with the mutation profile.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty subjects were observed to have mutations 
associated with resistance to FQs and constituted the final study population. 
The most frequent mutation observed among GyrA drug resistance mutation was D94G 
(Gyr A MUT3C, 44/150, 66%) corresponding to high-level resistance to 
levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The same mutation was associated with poor 
treatment outcome as died or treatment failure (odds ratio 2.50, relative risk 
1.67, P = 0.043). The most common hetero-resistance mutation pattern observed in 
GyrA gene was wild type plus Asp94Gly mutation in 24.6% of isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: GyrA MUT3C hybridization corresponding to single-point mutation of 
aspartic acid to glycine at codon 94 constitutes the most common mutation in 
GyrA gene locus in M. tuberculosis with significant association with treatment 
outcome as died compared to those with treatment outcome as cured.

Why the Vonoprazan Helicobacter pylori Therapies in the US-European Trial 
Produced Unacceptable Cure Rates.

INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori infects a large percentage of the world's 
population and is etiologically related to gastric cancer. The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration recently approved two 14-day vonoprazan-containing regimens 
(vonoprazan-amoxicillin with or without clarithromycin) for H. pylori infections 
in the United States/Europe.
METHODS: We critically reviewed the trial methods to discover why the results 
were unacceptable low [i.e., no regimen achieved clinically acceptable (≥ 90%) 
or even conditionally acceptable cure rates (≥ 85%)]. Cure rates with antibiotic 
susceptible strains were 84.7 for vonoprazan triple therapy, 78.5 for 
vonoprazan-amoxicillin, and 78.7 for lansoprazole triple therapy, respectively. 
As was previously shown in Japan, the benefit from adding clarithromycin to 
vonoprazan-amoxicillin was minimal and the majority of the clarithromycin 
administered was unnecessary.
RESULTS: The possible reasons for failure to achieve high cure rates discussed 
include (a) reduced intragastric antibiotic concentrations, (b) an increase in 
heteroresistance, and (c) failure to achieve an intragastric pH conducive for 
amoxicillin to eradicate the infection. In addition, there was no pilot study or 
other attempt to optimize any regimen.
CONCLUSION: The most likely reason for failure was failure to achieve high 
intragastric concentrations of antibiotics or to achieve an intragastric pH 
conducive for amoxicillin to be active. Importantly, vonoprazan triple therapy 
resulted in > 10 tons of unneeded clarithromycin/million courses of vonoprazan 
triple therapy. Antibiotic misuse combined with low cure rates suggest that 
vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapies should not be prescribed for H. 
pylori infection. Dual vonoprazan-amoxicillin therapy has proven effective 
elsewhere and after optimization may eventually prove useful in the U.S./Europe.

Polymyxins are a class of antibiotics that were discovered in 1947 from programs 
searching for compounds effective in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. 
Produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa and composed of a 
cyclic peptide chain with a peptide-fatty acyl tail, polymyxins exert 
bactericidal effects through membrane disruption. Currently, polymyxin B and 
colistin (polymyxin E) have been developed for clinical use, where they are 
reserved as "last-line" therapies for multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections. 
Unfortunately, the incidences of strains resistant to polymyxins have been 
increasing globally, and polymyxin heteroresistance has been gaining 
appreciation as an important clinical challenge. These phenomena, along with 
bacterial tolerance to this antibiotic class, constitute important contributors 
to polymyxin treatment failure. Here, we review polymyxins and their mechanism 
of action, summarize the current understanding of how polymyxin treatment fails, 
and discuss how the next generation of polymyxins holds promise to invigorate 
this antibiotic class.

In anaerobic infections, the relationship between clinical failure and 
antibiotic resistance is difficult to demonstrate, especially in mixed 
anaerobic-aerobic infections. Single isolates of anaerobes in cases of 
bacteraemia revealed that treatment failures were due to inappropriate therapy. 
We review here cases, where the empiric treatment was unsuccessful due to 
resistance of anaerobic bacteria to the administered agents and where the change 
of the antibiotic allowed the patients to be cured. Many therapeutic failures 
could be linked to the lack of timely detection of resistance, including 
heteroresistance of the anaerobes. Disk diffusion or Etest methodology may be 
suitable, at least for rapidly growing anaerobes, to detect both resistance and 
heteroresistance to antibiotics widely used for empirical therapy.

Heteroresistance is a poorly understood mechanism of resistance which refers to 
a phenomenon where there are different subpopulations of seemingly isogenic 
bacteria which exhibit a range of susceptibilities to a particular antibiotic. 
In the current study, we identified a multidrug-resistant, 
carbapenemase-positive K. pneumoniae strain SWMUF35 which was classified as 
susceptible to amikacin and resistant to meropenem by clinical diagnostics yet 
harbored different subpopulations of phenotypically resistant cells, and has the 
ability to form biofilm. Population analysis profile (PAP) indicated that 
SWMUF35 showed heteroresistance towards amikacin and meropenem which was 
considered as co-heteroresistant K. pneumoniae strain. In vitro experiments such 
as dual PAP, dual Times-killing assays and checkerboard assay showed that 
antibiotic combination therapy (amikacin combined with meropenem) can 
effectively combat SWMUF35. Importantly, using an in vivo mouse model of 
peritonitis, we found that amikacin or meropenem monotherapy was unable to 
rescue mice infected with SWMUF35. Antibiotic combination therapy could be a 
rational strategy to use clinically approved antibiotics when monotherapy would 
fail. Furthermore, our data warn that antibiotic susceptibility testing results 
may be unreliable due to undetected heteroresistance which can lead to treatment 
failure and the detection of this phenotype is a prerequisite for a proper 
choice of antibiotic to support a successful treatment outcome.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the minimum level of 
heteroresistance that predicts poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes. This 
retrospective study enrolled 45 new tuberculosis patients with varied treatment 
outcomes and 16 drug-susceptible retreatment cases. Pretreatment isolates from 
these 61 patients were whole genome sequenced to detect heteroresistance. 
Heteroresistance was not found in isolates from any of the new patients, but was 
detected in isolates from retreatment patients who were nevertheless cured. The 
results of our small series of patients suggest that heteroresistance <1%, the 
threshold used to define resistance with the phenotypic proportion method, is 
not associated with poor treatment outcomes.

The cure rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is relatively low in 
China. The reasons for the treatment failure and within-host evolution during 
treatment have not been sufficiently studied. All MDR-TB patients receiving 
standard treatment from January 2014 to September 2016 at a designated TB 
Hospital in Zhejiang Province were retrospectively included and grouped 
according to their known treatment outcome. Clinical information was collected. 
Baseline strains of all patients and serial strains of treatment-failure 
patients were revived. Drug susceptibility tests (DSTs) of 14 drugs and single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) 
were performed. The genetic distance and within-host evolution were investigated 
based on SNPs. In total, 20 treatment failure patients and 74 patients who 
succeeded in treatment were included. The number of effective drugs for patients 
who failed treatment was no more than three. Eighteen (90.0%) treatment-failure 
patients were characterized by a continuous infection of the primary strain, of 
which 14 patients (77.8%) developed phenotypic or genotypic acquired drug 
resistance under ineffective treatment. Acquired resistance to amikacin and 
moxifloxacin (2.0 mg/ml) was detected most frequently, in 5 and 4 patients, 
respectively. The insufficient number of effective drugs in the combined 
treatment regimen was the main reason for MDR-TB treatment failure. The study 
emphasizes the importance of DST for second-line drugs when implementing the 
second-line drug regimen in MDR-TB patients. For patients with risk factors for 
MDR-TB, DST of second-line antituberculosis drugs should be performed at 
initiation of treatment. Second-line drugs should be selected based on the 
results of DST to avoid acquired resistance. WGS detects low-frequency 
resistance mutations and heterogeneous resistance with high sensitivity, which 
is of great significance for guiding clinical treatment and preventing acquired 
resistance.IMPORTANCE Few studies have focused on the reasons for the low cure 
rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in China and within-host evolution 
during treatment, which is of great significance for improving clinical 
treatment regimens. Acquired resistance events were common during the 
ineffective treatment, among which resistance to amikacin and high-level 
moxifloxacin were the most common. The main reason for the treatment failure of 
MDR-TB patients was insufficient effective drugs, which may lead to higher 
levels of drug resistance in MDR-TB strains. Therefore, the study emphasizes the 
importance of DST in the development of second-line treatment regimen when there 
is a risk of MDR. By performing whole-genome sequencing of serial strains from 
patients with treatment failure, we found that WGS can detect low-frequency 
resistance mutations and heterogeneous resistance with high sensitivity. It is 
thus recommended to conduct drug susceptibility tests at the beginning of 
treatment and repeat the DST when the sputum bacteria remain positive.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of Candida albicans bloodstream infection with fluconazole 
is associated with significant mortality despite in vitro susceptibility to the 
drug.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether tolerance to fluconazole is 
predictive of treatment failure.
METHODS: We reviewed patients with monomicrobial C albicans bloodstream 
infection who received primary monotherapy with fluconazole. Tolerance to 
fluconazole, defined as the fraction of growth above the MIC, was quantified 
using the disc diffusion assay and digital image analyses. Survival analyses 
were performed with host and treatment factors as predictive variables.
RESULTS: Among 44 patients included in the study, all-cause mortality was 29.5% 
at 30 days and 43.1% at 12 weeks. Forty-one isolates (93%) were susceptible to 
fluconazole (MIC50, 0.5 mg/L). Fluconazole tolerance was strongly associated 
with death for patients treated with fluconazole within 24 h of candidemia onset 
(33.3% vs 0%; p = .007), but not among patients whose treatment was started 
later. MIC did not correlate with survival, regardless of treatment delay. A Cox 
regression model including time to treatment, tolerance to fluconazole, 
fluconazole exposure and Pitt bacteraemia score provided good prediction of 
treatment outcome (area under the receiver-operator curve, 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with C albicans bloodstream infection, tolerance 
testing was predictive of fluconazole efficacy if the drug was started early. 
Further study is required to validate the utility of this metric to guide 
treatment choices.

BACKGROUND: Patients with mixed-strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections may 
be at a high risk of poor treatment outcomes. However, the mechanisms through 
which mixed infections affect the clinical manifestations are not well 
recognized. Evidence suggests that failure to detect the pathogen diversity 
within the host can influence the clinical results. We aimed to investigate the 
effects of different genotypes in mixed infections and determine their 
relationship with heteroresistance in the treatment of Iranian tuberculosis 
patients.
METHODS: One of the genotypes was identified in the culture and another genotype 
pattern in the mixed infection was predicted by comparing the pattern of 
MIRU-VNTR between the clinical specimens and their respective cultures in each 
patient. For all patients, the drug susceptibility testing was carried out on 
three single colonies from each clinical sample. The follow-up of patients was 
carried out during six months of treatment.
RESULTS: Based on MIRU-VNTR profiles of clinical samples, we showed that 55.6% 
(25/45) of the Iranian patients included in the study had mixed infections. 
Patients with mixed infections had a higher rate of treatment failure, compared 
to others (P=0.03). By comparing clinical sample profiles to profiles obtained 
after culture, we were able to distinguish between major and hidden genotypes. 
Among hidden genotypes, Haarlem (L4.1.2) and Beijing (L2) were associated to 
treatment failure (6/8 patients).
CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, we propose a procedure using the MIRU-VNTR method to 
identify the different genotypes in mixed infections. The present findings 
suggest that genotypes with potentially higher pathogenicity may not be detected 
when performing experimental culture in patients with mixed infections.

A patient who had initial infection with mixed strains of drug-susceptible and 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was presumed to have acquired drug resistance 
before confirmation that sequential strains were genotypically distinct. 
Transmitted infection with mixed strains is likely underappreciated; identifying 
these infections requires spoligotyping and whole-genome sequencing.

Antibiotic heteroresistance is a phenotype in which a bacterial isolate contains 
subpopulations of cells that show a substantial reduction in antibiotic 
susceptibility compared with the main population. Recent work indicates that 
heteroresistance is very common for several different bacterial species and 
antibiotic classes. The resistance phenotype is often unstable, and in the 
absence of antibiotic pressure it rapidly reverts to susceptibility. A common 
mechanistic explanation for the instability is the occurrence of genetically 
unstable tandem amplifications of genes that cause resistance. Due to their 
instability, low frequency and transient character, it is challenging to detect 
and study these subpopulations, which often leads to difficulties in 
unambiguously classifying bacteria as susceptible or resistant. Finally, in 
vitro experiments, mathematical modelling, animal infection models and clinical 
studies show that the resistant subpopulations can be enriched during antibiotic 
exposure, and increasing evidence suggests that heteroresistance can lead to 
treatment failure.

Forty patients infected by Helicobacter pylori were studied. The treatment was 
based on the positivity or negativity of cultures (tailored therapy or empiric 
therapy). The eradication rate was 68% and 82% respectively. Genotypic 
susceptibility testing proved very useful in case of heteroresistance or mixed 
infections that represent a real problem possibly leading to a resistance 
underestimation. Real-time PCR detected the resistant population at a very low 
concentration not detectable by phenotypic tests. Bismuth quadruple therapy 
(PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline, PBMT) was effective in the Hp 
eradication rate consistent with a high level of clarithromycin resistance.

With the increasing incidence of multi-drug resistant strains, especially 
carbapenem resistant strains, polymyxsins (mainly colistin and polymyxin B) 
based regimens seem to be a revival as an effective treatment of last resort in 
these infections. Evidence from 47 clinical trials or case series we reviewed 
showed that polymyxins based regimens are effective and have less toxicity 
compared with previous trials. When used alone, the mortality of intravenous 
polymyxsins ranged from 0% to 74.3%, clinical response (cure and improvement) 
rate was 7-82.1%, and microbiological eradication was 27.3-73.9%. The main 
reasons for the combination therapy are to get potential synergistic effects and 
to prevent the selection of heteroresistant strains. Several studies showed 
combination therapy seemed to be more effective than monotherapy, though a few 
doubts remain. Clinically, polymyxsins can be used in combination with several 
antibiotics, such as carberpenem, sulbactam, tigecycline, fosfomycin, 
glycopeptide, rifampicin and so on, but the optimal combination regimen is yet 
to be confirmed. The optimal dose of polymyxins is also controversial. With the 
limited clinical evidence, it's suggested loading dose regimens may be more 
effective, but more attention should be paid to adverse effects. Although 
recommended in some studies, high dose polymxins regimens with inconsistent 
clinical evidence need more trials to confirm. It is important to note that 
concerning dosing regimens, colistin and polymyxin B are not quite the same. In 
renal impaired patients polymyxin B should be prescribed without dosing 
adjustment. Risk of renal failure may increase in the following situations, such 
as the combination of intravenous colistin plus intravenous vancomycin, higher 
doses-colistin, and intravenous colistin combined with inhalational colistin. In 
conclusion, there're still controversies in combination regimens, dosing 
strategies and so on. Prospective trials of lager sample size are needed.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (MRSAB) often persists 
despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. It is unclear what microbiological 
factors contribute to poor clinical outcomes in persistent MRSAB (pMRSAB). We 
aimed to identify clinical and microbiological risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality in pMRSAB. We analysed MRSAB cases prospectively collected between 
2009 and 2016 at 11 hospitals in Korea, defining cases of pMRSAB as MRSAB 
lasting ≥5 days despite administration of effective antibiotics. The first blood 
isolates from the pMRSAB cases were tested for staphylococcal cassette 
chromosome mec type, staphylococcal protein A type, accessary gene regulator 
(agr) type, genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and phenol-soluble 
modulin-mec, vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration, vancomycin 
heteroresistance, and agr functionality. We also collected clinical information 
for each case. Of 960 MRSAB cases, 152 pMRSAB were finally eligible. Univariable 
analysis revealed that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with 
Charlson's comorbidity-weighted index (CCWI) score, Pitt bacteremia score, 
sequential organ failure assessment score, presentation with septic shock, 
pneumonia, agr dysfunction, and vancomycin heteroresistance. Bone and joint 
infections were negatively associated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariable 
analysis revealed the following independent risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality: CCWI score [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), per one point, 1.25; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.44; P = 0.003), Pitt bacteremia score (aOR, per 
one point, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09-1.62; P = 0.005), non-eradicated foci of infection 
(aOR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.18-8.27; P = 0.022), and agr dysfunction (aOR, 2.48; 95% 
CI, 1.12-5.47; P = 0.025). agr dysfunction is an independent risk factor for 
in-hospital mortality in pMRSAB.

Persistent bacteraemia (PB) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) that fails to respond to glycopeptide therapy is a well-documented 
clinical problem. There are limited data on changes in agr functionality, 
vancomycin susceptibility and heteroresistance during MRSA PB. Thus, the 
frequency of these changes and their clinical significance remain unclear. Only 
patients with MRSA PB (≥7 days) from a prospective cohort of S. aureus 
bacteraemia were included. We collected isogenic paired strains and compared 
vancomycin MIC, vancomycin heteroresistance, and agr functionality between 
initial and final blood isolates. We also assessed the clinical outcome. A total 
of 49 patients had MRSA PB over 22 months. Bacteraemia persisted for a median of 
13 days and most patients (98%) received glycopeptide as initial therapy. Among 
49 isogenic pairs, only one pair showed a vancomycin MIC increase ≥2-fold by 
broth microdilution method, and only seven (14%) by E-test. Significant portions 
of initial isolates had vancomycin heteroresistance (49%) and agr dysfunction 
(76%). Development of vancomycin heteroresistance during PB occurred in four 
(16%) among 25 initial vancomycin-susceptible isolates, and acquisition of agr 
dysfunction occurred in two (16%) among 12 initial agr-functional isolates. 
Changes in the opposite direction occasionally occurred. These phenotypic 
changes during PB were not associated with mortality, whereas agr dysfunction of 
the initial isolates was significantly associated with mortality. During MRSA 
PB, phenotypic changes of MRSA isolates occurred occasionally under prolonged 
vancomycin exposure but were not significantly associated with clinical outcome. 
In contrast, initial agr dysfunction could be a predictor for mortality in MRSA 
PB.

Our aim was to describe the clinical and microbiological features of four cases 
of severe vancomycin-susceptible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) infections in which the vancomycin non-susceptibility development and 
daptomycin resistance occurred under therapy with teicoplanin (three cases) and 
daptomycin switched to vancomycin (one case). Clinical data were retrospectively 
reviewed. On nine clinical epidemiologically unrelated daptomycin-susceptible 
(DAP-S) and daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) MRSA, we performed: (i) 
DAP-VAN-TEC-CFX-RIF minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs); (ii) glycopeptide 
resistance detection (GRD) by δ-hemolysis; (iii) glycopeptide population 
analysis; (iv) molecular characterization by PFGE-MLST-SCCmec-agr-typing; (v) 
rpoB and mprF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (vi) dltA-mprF-atl-sceD 
expression by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Three out 
of the four patients did not survive despite salvage treatment; two died with 
active MRSA infection and one died because of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 
sepsis. The fourth patient, in which a reversion to a DAP-S phenotype occurred, 
survived with daptomycin plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and oxacillin 
treatment, and endovascular device removal. Daptomycin resistance development 
was preceded by a stable heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) 
or VISA phenotype acquisition, while in one case, daptomycin resistance was 
preceded by an unstable daptomycin heteroresistance (hDAP) behavior reverting to 
DAP-S during vancomycin plus rifampin therapy followed by high doses of 
daptomycin. All DAP-R strains showed hVISA or DAP-R traits, including mutations 
and/or up-regulation of genes involved in cell wall turnover and cell membrane 
perturbation. In our study, daptomycin resistance arose during glycopeptide 
therapy. The emergence of DAP-R isolates was preceded by a stable VISA or hVISA 
phenotype or by instability reverting to a DAP-S heteroresistant phenotype. 
Daptomycin, as first-line therapy for the treatment of severe MRSA infections, 
should be used at optimal dosage combined with other agents such as 
beta-lactams, to prevent daptomycin resistance occurrence.

Vancomycin remains the mainstay treatment for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, including pneumonia. There is concern 
regarding the emergence of vancomycin tolerance, caused by heterogeneous 
vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA), and subsequent vancomycin treatment 
failure. Pneumonia is associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially 
with delays in appropriate therapy. This study evaluated the clinical outcomes 
of patients with hVISA pneumonia compared to those with vancomycin-susceptible 
S. aureus (VSSA) pneumonia. A retrospective cohort of patients with MRSA 
pneumonia from 2005 to 2014 was matched at a ratio of 2:1 VSSA to hVISA 
infections to compare patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. hVISA 
was determined by the 48-h population analysis profile area under the curve. 
Characteristics between VSSA and hVISA infections were compared by univariate 
analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine independent 
risk factors of inpatient mortality. Eighty-seven patients were included, 
representing 29 hVISA and 58 VSSA cases of pneumonia. There were no significant 
differences in demographics or baseline characteristics. Sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) scores were a median of 7 (interquartile ratio [IQR], 
5 to 8) in hVISA patients and 5 (IQR, 3 to 8) in VSSA (P = 0.092) patients. 
Inpatient mortality was significantly higher in hVISA patients (44.8% versus 
24.1%; P = 0.049). Predictors of inpatient mortality upon multivariable 
regression were SOFA score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.36; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.70), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positivity (aOR, 
6.63; 95% CI, 1.79 to 24.64), and hVISA phenotype (aOR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.18 to 
13.21). Patients with hVISA pneumonia experienced significantly higher inpatient 
mortality than those with VSSA pneumonia. There is a need to consider the 
presence of vancomycin heteroresistance in pneumonia caused by MRSA in order to 
potentially improve clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data about the epidemiology and treatment-related 
outcomes associated with capreomycin resistance in patients with XDR-TB. 
Capreomycin achieves high serum concentrations relative to MIC but whether 
capreomycin has therapeutic benefit despite microbiological resistance remains 
unclear.
METHODS: We reviewed the susceptibility profiles and outcomes associated with 
capreomycin usage in patients diagnosed with XDR-TB between August 2002 and 
October 2012 in two provinces of South Africa. Patients whose isolates were 
genotypically tested for capreomycin resistance were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: Of 178 XDR-TB patients 41% were HIV-infected. 87% (154/178) isolates 
contained a capreomycin resistance-conferring mutation [80% (143/178) rrs A1401G 
and 6% (11/178) were heteroresistant (containing both the rrs A1401G mutation 
and wild-type sequences)]. Previous MDR-TB treatment, prior usage of kanamycin, 
or strain type was not associated with capreomycin resistance. 92% (163/178) of 
XDR-TB patients were empirically treated with capreomycin. Capreomycin 
resistance decreased the odds of sputum culture conversion. In capreomycin 
sensitive and resistant persons combined weight at diagnosis was the only 
independent predictor for survival (p=<0.001). By contrast, HIV status and use 
of co-amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were independent predictors of mortality 
(p=<0.05). Capreomycin usage was not associated with survival or culture 
conversion when the analysis was restricted to those whose isolates were 
resistant to capreomycin.
CONCLUSION: In South Africa the frequency of capreomycin conferring mutations 
was extremely high in XDR-TB isolates. In those with capreomycin resistance 
there appeared to be no therapeutic benefit of using capreomycin. These data 
inform susceptibility testing and the design of treatment regimens for XDR-TB in 
TB endemic settings.

OBJECTIVES: Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged in the community and 
has recently been spreading in healthcare settings. The objectives of this study 
were to evaluate the clinical outcomes and bacterial virulence factors of the 
Korean CA-MRSA (ST72-SCCmecIV) strain, which causes bloodstream infections.
METHODS: All adult patients with MRSA bacteraemia were prospectively enrolled. 
Clinical outcomes, microbiological characteristics and 40 bacterial virulence 
factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 352 typed MRSA isolates, 342 isolates (97.2%) belonged to three 
Panton-Valentine leucocidin-negative strains: ST5-SCCmecII (70.2%), 
ST72-SCCmecIV (22.4%) and ST239-SCCmecIII (4.6%). The remaining 10 (2.8%) 
isolates from minor strains were excluded from the final analysis. After 
controlling for several confounding factors, ST72-SCCmecIV was associated with 
the lowest mortality (compared with ST5-SCCmecII, adjusted OR=0.26; 95% 
CI=0.13-0.54). However, MRSA isolates with vancomycin MICs of ≥ 1.5 mg/L were 
more common in ST72-SCCmecIV compared with ST5-SCCmecII (84.8% versus 66.7%; 
P=0.002). Reduced vancomycin susceptibility and vancomycin heteroresistance were 
not associated with mortality. Compared with ST5-SCCmecII isolates, 
ST72-SCCmecIV isolates were less likely to harbour multiple virulence genes. Of 
these genes, three staphylococcal superantigen genes were associated with 
mortality: sec (OR=2.31; P=0.002), sel (OR=2.55; P=0.003) and tst (OR=2.76; 
P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for confounding factors, ST72-SCCmecIV was 
independently associated with lower mortality compared with ST5-SCCmecII, 
suggesting this CA-MRSA strain to be of lower virulence. The lack of virulence 
genes, including staphylococcal superantigen genes, may play a role in the lower 
virulence of this strain.

Elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin against 
meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the emergence of 
heteroresistant S. aureus strains have led to increased use of anti-MRSA 
antibiotics other than vancomycin. Ceftaroline fosamil is a novel cephalosporin 
with activity against MRSA, but there are limited clinical data on its use for 
MRSA bacteraemia (MRSAB) and against strains exhibiting high vancomycin MICs 
(2-4 μg/mL). This multicentre, retrospective, case-control study compared the 
microbiological and clinical effectiveness of ceftaroline used after vancomycin 
failure with that of vancomycin-treated controls for the treatment of MRSA with 
vancomycin MICs ≥ 2 μg/mL. In total, 32 patients were matched 1:1 with respect 
to vancomycin MIC, age and origin of bacteraemia. In the ceftaroline group, 
patients received prior MRSA therapy for a median of 5 days [interquartile range 
(IQR), 3-15.8 days] prior to switching to ceftaroline. Median time to 
eradication of MRSA was significantly less after treatment with ceftaroline 
compared with vancomycin [4 days (IQR, 3-7.5 days) vs. 8 days (IQR, 5.8-19.5 
days); P=0.02]. Both clinical success at the end of treatment and recurrence of 
MRSA at Day 7 were trending towards being inferior in the vancomycin group, 
although the results did not attain statistical significance [81% vs. 44% 
(P=0.06) and 6% vs. 38% (P=0.08), respectively]. Ceftaroline added at the point 
of vancomycin failure resolves MRSAB more rapidly and with a higher rate of 
clinical success, therefore ceftaroline should be considered as an alternative 
for these difficult-to-treat infections.

OBJECTIVES: Several phenotypic characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus have 
been identified as aetiological factors responsible for adverse outcomes among 
patients receiving vancomycin. However, characterization of the outcomes 
associated with these reduced vancomycin susceptibility phenotypes (rVSPs) 
remains largely incomplete and it is unknown if these features contribute to 
deleterious treatment outcomes alone or in concert. This study described the 
interrelationship between rVSPs and assessed their individual and combined 
effects on outcomes among patients who received vancomycin for a 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection.
METHODS: An observational study of adult, hospitalized patients with MRSA 
bloodstream infections who were treated with vancomycin between January 2005 and 
June 2009 was performed. The rVSPs evaluated included the following: (i) Etest 
MIC; (ii) broth microdilution MIC; (iii) MBC : MIC ratio; and (iv) 
heteroresistance to vancomycin by the Etest macromethod. Failure was defined as 
any of the following: (i) 30 day mortality; (ii) bacteraemia ≥ 7 days on 
therapy; or (iii) recurrence of MRSA bacteraemia within 60 days of therapy 
discontinuation.
RESULTS: During the study period, 184 cases met the study criteria and 41.3% met 
the failure criteria. There was a clear linear exposure-response relationship 
between the number of these phenotypic markers and outcomes. As the number of 
phenotypes escalated, the incidence of overall failure increased incrementally 
by 10%-18%.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that rVSPs contribute to deleterious treatment 
outcomes in concert.

Increasing use of colistin for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial 
infections has led to the emergence of colistin resistance in Klebsiella 
pneumoniae in several countries worldwide, including Europe (especially Greece), 
and colistin resistance rates are continually increasing. Heteroresistance 
rates, which were significantly higher than resistance rates, were found to be 
important. Although the mechanism underlying resistance is unclear, it has been 
suggested that it is related to lipopolysaccharide modification via diverse 
routes. Several factors have been reported as being associated with colistin 
resistance, with improper use and patient-to-patient transmission being most 
often cited. Total infections and infection-related mortality from 
colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae are high, but currently there are no 
established treatment regimens. However, several combination regimens that are 
mainly colistin-based have been found to be successful for treating such 
infections.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis may have 
phenotypic heterogeneity in results of drug-susceptibility tests (DSTs). 
However, the impact of this on clinical outcomes among patients treated for MDR 
tuberculosis is unknown.
METHODS: Phenotypic DST heterogeneity was defined as presence of at least 1 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid 
recovered <3 months after MDR tuberculosis treatment initiation from a patient 
with previous documented tuberculosis due to M. tuberculosis resistant to at 
least rifampicin and isoniazid. The primary outcome was defined as good (ie, 
cure or treatment completion) or poor (ie, treatment failure, treatment default, 
or death). A secondary outcome was time to culture conversion. Cox proportional 
hazard models were used to determine the association between phenotypic DST 
heterogeneity and outcomes.
RESULTS: Phenotypic DST heterogeneity was identified in 33 of 475 patients (7%) 
with MDR tuberculosis. Poor outcome occurred in 126 patients (28%). Overall, 
patients with MDR tuberculosis who had phenotypic DST heterogeneity were at 
greater risk of poor outcome than those with MDR tuberculosis but no phenotypic 
DST heterogeneity (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.2-3.6). Among HIV-infected patients with MDR tuberculosis, the adjusted 
hazard for a poor outcome for those with phenotypic DST heterogeneity was 2.4 
(95% CI, 1.3-4.2) times that for those without phenotypic DST heterogeneity, 
whereas among HIV-negative patients with MDR tuberculosis, the adjusted hazard 
for those with phenotypic DST heterogeneity was 1.5 (95% CI, .5-4.3) times that 
for those without phenotypic DST heterogeneity. HIV-infected patients with MDR 
tuberculosis with phenotypic DST heterogeneity also had a longer time to culture 
conversion than with HIV-infected patients with MDR tuberculosis without 
phenotypic DST heterogeneity (aHR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4-6.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic DST heterogeneity among persons with HIV infection who 
are being treated for MDR tuberculosis is associated with poor outcomes and 
longer times to culture conversion.

Patients with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and 
heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) infection 
are associated with treatment failure and poor outcomes. The main purpose of 
this study was to investigate the effect of hVISA on patient outcome, 
considering both the high vancomycin MIC and the existence of heteroresistant 
phenotypes. From January 2005 to December 2009, consecutive meticillin-resistant 
S. aureus (MRSA) isolates from 284 cases of MRSA bacteraemia receiving 
glycopeptide therapy were collected for further MIC and hVISA testing. The 
demographic distribution, clinical features and outcomes in bacteraemia patients 
with different vancomycin MICs and hVISA status in MRSA isolates were 
subsequently compared. Subjects were divided into three groups: low vancomycin 
MIC (<1.5mg/L) with vancomycin-sensitive S. aureus (VSSA) (n=50); high 
vancomycin MIC (≥1.5mg/L) with VSSA (n=218); and high vancomycin MIC with hVISA 
(n=16). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the high MIC with VSSA group 
exhibited significantly higher 30-day mortality than the low MIC with VSSA group 
[odds ratio (OR)=2.349, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.078-5.118]. The high MIC 
with hVISA phenotype was not associated with higher mortality but was 
independently associated with persistent MRSA bacteraemia (OR=5.996, 95% CI 
1.438-25.005). To summarise, although hVISA is correlated with persistent 
bacteraemia, higher mortality in high vancomycin MIC infections could not be 
explained by the existing hVISA phenotype. Facing persistent bacteraemia under 
glycopeptide therapy for 7 days, clinicians should consider shifting to an 
alternative class of antibiotics to treat hVISA infection.

Persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) that fails to respond to 
appropriate antibiotic therapy is associated with poor outcomes. Comprehensive 
prospective studies on risk factors and outcomes of persistent bacteremia are 
limited. We investigated outcomes and risk factors encompassing clinical, 
pharmacokinetic, microbiologic, and genotypic characteristics associated with 
persistent bacteremia using a case-control study nested in a prospective cohort 
of patients with SAB at a tertiary-care hospital from August 2008 through 
September 2010. We compared the clinical characteristics, management, and 
outcomes of patients with persistent bacteremia (≥7 d) with controls with 
resolving bacteremia (<3 d). To detect associations between microbiologic and 
genotypic characteristics of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates and 
persistent bacteremia, we determined the heteroresistance phenotype, SCCmec 
type, agr genotype and functionality, multilocus sequence typing, and presence 
of 41 virulence genes. Our cohort consisted of 483 patients; 76 (15.7%) had 
persistent bacteremia, 212 (43.5%) had resolving bacteremia. In the multivariate 
analysis, independent risk factors associated with persistent bacteremia were 
community-onset bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.24-6.87), bone and joint infection (OR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.45-19.03), central 
venous catheter-related infection (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.47-7.65), metastatic 
infection (OR, 36.22; 95% CI, 12.71-103.23), and methicillin resistance (OR, 
16.99; 95% CI, 5.53-52.15). For patients with eradicable foci, delay (>3 d) in 
the removal of the infection focus was significantly associated with persistent 
bacteremia (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.05-4.55). There were no significant associations 
of persistent bacteremia with high vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration, 
vancomycin heteroresistance, and microbiologic/genotypic characteristics of MRSA 
isolates. However, initial vancomycin trough level <15 mg/L was an independent 
risk factor for persistent MRSA bacteremia (OR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.51-11.96) in the 
multivariate analysis. Clinical outcomes were significantly worse for patients 
with persistent bacteremia. Relapse of bacteremia and attributable mortality 
within 12 weeks after SAB were significantly higher in patients with persistent 
bacteremia than in those with resolving bacteremia (9.2% [7/76] vs. 2.4% 
[5/212], p = 0.02 and 21.1% [16/76] vs. 9.4% [20/212], p = 0.009, respectively). 
In conclusion, patients with SAB should be given early aggressive treatment 
strategies, including early source control and maintenance of a vancomycin 
trough level ≥15 mg/L, to reduce the risk of persistent bacteremia.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of the patients who were infected with 
colistin-only-susceptible (COS) Acinetobacter baumannii and treated with either 
colistin monotherapy or colistin combined therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control study was conducted in 
the training and research hospital with an 800 beds between August 2008 and 
December 2011. The patients, who were infected with COS A. baumannii and 
received either colistin monotherapy or colistin combined therapy, were included 
into the study.
RESULTS: In total, 51 patients fulfilling study criteria were evaluated. 
Colistin monotherapy was found effective as much as colistin combined therapy in 
terms of clinical and microbiological responses in patients with ventilator 
associated pneumonia (VAP) and also in patients with blood stream infections.
CONCLUSION: Although there is no randomised controlled study yet, colistin 
monotherapy and colistin combined therapy are likely to achieve similar 
treatment responses rates. Heteroresistant strains can emerge in patients who 
receive colistin monotherapy.

Fluconazole resistance in cryptococcal disease: emerging or intrinsic?

With the widespread use of long-term fluconazole prophylaxis and suppressive 
treatment, the potential development of fluconazole resistance poses a threat to 
the management of cryptococcal disease. Interpretive breakpoints for the in 
vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of C. neoformans have not been 
established and it is unclear whether the fluconazole minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) is clinically relevant. To gain insight into the management 
of patients with cryptococcosis who fail fluconazole therapy, we conducted a 
PubMed literature search for cases of fluconazole-resistant cryptococcosis 
reported from 1991 to 2011. A total of 20 such cases were identified in which 
most patients had AIDS and 30% had never had prior exposure to fluconazole. 
Fluconazole failure in patients with cryptococcal disease cannot be fully 
attributed to emerging resistance of the etiologic agent and heteroresistance is 
a potential alternative mechanism. There is a need to refine the definition of 
fluconazole-resistant cryptococcosis and additional studies of such patients 
will improve treatment strategies and outcomes.

Vancomycin has been used successfully for over 50 years for the treatment of 
Staphylococcus aureus infections, particularly those involving 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus. It has proven remarkably reliable, but its 
efficacy is now being questioned with the emergence of strains of S. aureus that 
display heteroresistance, intermediate resistance, and, occasionally, complete 
vancomycin resistance. More recently, an association has been established 
between poor outcome and infections with strains of S. aureus with an elevated 
vancomycin MIC within the susceptible range. This minireview summarizes the 
definitions, mechanisms, clinical impact, and laboratory identification of 
reduced vancomycin susceptibility in S. aureus and discusses practical issues 
for the diagnostic laboratory in testing and interpreting vancomycin 
susceptibility for S. aureus infections.

OBJECTIVES: We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of, and the 
bacterial genotypes in, patients with bacteraemia due to heteroresistant 
vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) and vancomycin-susceptible 
S. aureus (VSSA).
METHODS: A total of 268 consecutive patients with methicillin-resistant S. 
aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia were prospectively enrolled. All isolates were 
selected on the first day of bacteraemia and subjected to population analysis 
profiling for identification of hVISA phenotype and PCR analysis for 41 
virulence factors.
RESULTS: Of 268 MRSA isolates, 101 (37.7%) were identified as hVISA. Overall 
mortality was similar in hVISA- and VSSA-infected patients (45/101 versus 
65/167; P = 0.36). The following factors were independently associated with the 
presence of hVISA: a vancomycin MIC ≥2 mg/L by Etest [adjusted OR (aOR), 9.98; 
95% CI, 4.22-23.59], rifampicin resistance (aOR, 5.74; 95% CI, 1.35-24.37), 
prior vancomycin therapy (aOR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.49-6.17) and use of 
immunosuppressive therapy (aOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.12-5.17). Among patients with 
hVISA, bacteraemia was more likely to persist for ≥7 days in patients with an 
initial vancomycin trough <15 mg/L than in those with an initial trough ≥15 mg/L 
(13/34 versus 5/35; P = 0.02). The hVISA and VSSA isolates were genotypically 
similar.
CONCLUSIONS: The hVISA phenotype was present in more than one-third of MRSA 
isolates and was independently associated with several baseline factors. 
Although this phenotype did not affect patient outcomes, our results indicate 
that targeting an initial vancomycin trough of 15-20 mg/L may be beneficial in 
patients with hVISA bacteraemia.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of 
nosocomial pneumonia. To characterize pathogen-derived and host-related factors 
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with MRSA pneumonia, we evaluated the 
Improving Medicine through Pathway Assessment of Critical Therapy in 
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (IMPACT-HAP) database. We performed multivariate 
regression analyses of 28-day mortality and clinical response using univariate 
analysis variables at a P level of <0.25. In isolates from 251 patients, the 
most common molecular characteristics were USA100 (55.0%) and USA300 (23.9%), 
SCCmec types II (64.1%) and IV (33.1%), and agr I (36.7%) and II (61.8%). 
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was present in 21.9%, and vancomycin 
heteroresistance was present in 15.9%. Mortality occurred in 37.1% of patients; 
factors in the univariate analysis were age, APACHE II score, AIDS, cardiac 
disease, vascular disease, diabetes, SCCmec type II, PVL negativity, and higher 
vancomycin MIC (all P values were <0.05). In multivariate analysis, independent 
predictors were APACHE II score (odds ratio [OR], 1.090; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.041 to 1.141; P < 0.001) and age (OR, 1.024; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.046; P = 
0.02). Clinical failure occurred in 36.8% of 201 evaluable patients; the only 
independent predictor was APACHE II score (OR, 1.082; 95% CI, 1.031 to 1.136; P 
= 0.002). In summary, APACHE II score (mortality, clinical failure) and age 
(mortality) were the only independent predictors, which is consistent with 
severity of illness in ICU patients with MRSA pneumonia. Interestingly, our 
univariate findings suggest that both pathogen and host factors influence 
outcomes. As the epidemiology of MRSA pneumonia continues to evolve, both 
pathogen- and host-related factors should be considered when describing 
epidemiological trends and outcomes of therapeutic interventions.

Drug resistance mutations and heteroresistance detected using the GenoType 
MTBDRplus assay and their implication for treatment outcomes in patients from 
Mumbai, India.

BACKGROUND: Only 5% of the estimated global multidrug resistant TB (MDRTB) load 
is currently detected. Endemic Mumbai with increasing MDR would benefit from the 
introduction of molecular methods to detect resistance.
METHODS: The GenoType MTBDRplus assay was used to determine mutations associated 
with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance and their correlation with treatment 
outcomes. It was performed on a convenience sample comprising 88 onset and 67 
fifth month isolates for which phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was 
determined by the Buddemeyer technique for an earlier study. Simultaneous 
presence of wild type and mutant bands was referred to as "mixed patterns" 
(heteroresistance).
RESULTS: Phenotypically 41 isolates were sensitive; 11 isoniazid, 2 rifampicin, 
2 pyrazinamide and 5 ethambutol monoresistant; 16 polyresistant and 78 MDR. The 
agreement between both methods was excellent (kappa = 0.72-0.92). Of 22 
rifampicin resistant onset isolates, the predominant rpoB mutations were the 
singular lack of WT8 (n = 8) and mixed D516V patterns (n = 9). Of the 64 
rifampicin resistant fifth month isolates, the most frequent mutations were in 
WT8 (n = 31) with a further 9 showing the S531L mutation. Mixed patterns were 
seen in 22 (34%) isolates, most frequently for the D516V mutation (n = 21). Of 
the 22 onset and 35 fifth month katG mutants, 13 and 12 respectively showed the 
S315T1 mutation with loss of the WT. Mixed patterns involving both S315T1 and 
S315T2 were seen in 9 and 23 isolates respectively. Seventeen of 23 and 23/35 
inhA mutant onset and fifth month isolates showed mixed A16G profiles. 
Additionally, 10 fifth month isolates lacked WT2. Five onset and 6 fifth month 
isolates had both katG and inhA mutations. An association was noted between only 
katG but not only inhA resistance and poor outcome (p = 0.037); and additional 
resistance to ethambutol (p = 0.0033). More fifth month than onset isolates had 
mixed profiles for at least 1 gene (p = 0.000001).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the assay to rapidly diagnose MDR could guide 
simultaneous first- and second-line DST, and reduce the delay in administering 
appropriate regimens. Furthermore, detection of heteroresistance could prevent 
inaccurate "cured" treatment outcomes documented through smear microscopy and 
permit more sensitive detection of neonascent resistance.

BACKGROUND: Despite hVISA infections being associated with vancomycin treatment 
failure, no previous study has been able to detect a mortality difference 
between heteroresistant vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) 
and vancomycin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) bloodstream infections 
(BSI).
METHODOLOGY: Consecutive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) BSI episodes 
between 1996 and 2008 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical 
presentation, treatment and overall mortality at 30 days were extracted from the 
medical records. All isolates underwent vancomycin minimum inhibitory 
concentration (VMIC) testing by broth microdilution and Etest. hVISA was 
confirmed by population analysis profiling using the area under the curve method 
(PAP-AUC).
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 401 evaluable MRSA BSI episodes were identified over the 12 
years. Of these, 46 (11.5%) and 2 (0.5%) were confirmed as hVISA and VISA by 
PAP-AUC respectively. hVISA predominantly occurred in ST239-like MRSA isolates 
with high VMIC (2 mg/L). Compared to VSSA, hVISA was associated with chronic 
renal failure (p<0.001), device related infections (haemodialysis access) 
(p<0.001) and previous vancomycin usage (p = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, 
independent predictors of mortality included age, presence of multiple 
co-morbidities, principal diagnosis, transit to ICU and severity of illness 
while infection related surgery and hVISA phenotype were associated with 
increased survival.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of hVISA is dependent on the appropriate 
interplay between host and pathogen factors. hVISA in ST239 MRSA is an 
independent predictor of survival. Whether these findings would be replicated 
across all MRSA clones is unknown and warrants further study.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relevance of vancomycin-intermediate susceptibility 
(VISA) and heteroresistance (hVISA) in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia.
METHODS: We determined vancomycin MICs for 371 saved MRSA blood isolates 
(2002-03; 2005-06) by Etest and broth microdilution (BMD), screened for hVISA 
(Etest methods), determined the population analysis profile (PAP)/AUC for 
isolates with suspected reduced susceptibility (MICs >2 mg/L and/or 
hVISA-screen-positive versus Mu3 (hVISA control), and stratified patient 
characteristics and outcome according to susceptibility phenotype: VISA (PAP/AUC 
>1.3), hVISA (PAP/AUC 0.9-1.3), and susceptible (S-MRSA; PAP/AUC <0.9).
RESULTS: PAP/AUC revealed 6 (1.6%) VISA and 30 (8.1%) hVISA phenotypes. The 
Etest MIC was above the susceptibility cut-off (2 mg/L) for all VISA isolates, 
whereas the BMD MIC was within the susceptibility range in two (33.3%) 
instances. Eight hVISA isolates (26.7%) with MICs of 2 mg/L were hVISA-screen 
negative. SCCmec typing revealed SCCmec II in 100% of VISA, 86.7% of hVISA and 
75.5% of S-MRSA isolates (P = 0.04). Prior vancomycin use was documented in 100% 
of VISA, 73.3% of hVISA and 52.2% of S-MRSA cases (P = 0.002). Outcome (compared 
in 243 vancomycin-treated patients with MICs of 2 mg/L) revealed longer time to 
clearance in VISA cases [12.1 ± 13.1 days versus 3.3 ± 3.9 (hVISA) and 3.7 ± 5.1 
(S-MRSA); P = 0.001], more frequent endocarditis [33.3% versus 9.1% (hVISA; 
P = 0.1) and 4.2% (S-MRSA; P = 0.001)] and attributable mortality [33.3% versus 
9.1% (hVISA; P = 0.1) and 8.4% (S-MRSA); P = 0.08].
CONCLUSIONS: No adverse outcome was documented with hVISA phenotype, whereas 
VISA contributed to vancomycin treatment failure. VISA and hVISA appear to 
emerge in SCCmec II isolates among vancomycin-exposed patients and are better 
detected by Etest.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish the relationship between 
reduced vancomycin and daptomycin susceptibility among Australasian 
vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous-VISA 
(hVISA) isolates from patients never exposed to daptomycin.
METHODS: Forty-seven stored clinical isolates of hVISA/VISA collected before 
November 2008 from around Australia and New Zealand were selected. Daptomycin 
and vancomycin MIC testing was performed using broth microdilution (BMD) and 
Etest methods. Daptomycin population analysis was performed on a subset of 
isolates.
RESULTS: The percentage of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates was 0% for 
vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) (Etest and BMD), for hVISA it was 26% by 
Etest and 15% by BMD, and for VISA 62% by Etest and 38% by BMD. Population 
analysis profile testing demonstrated daptomycin heteroresistance among the 
hVISA and VISA strains tested.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the highest rate of daptomycin non-susceptibility reported 
among hVISA isolates to date. Clinicians should exhibit caution when using 
daptomycin in situations where serious hVISA or VISA infection is a possibility.

Gram-positive cocci are the most common cause of bloodstream infections in 
hemodialysis patients, with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative 
staphylococci causing most infections. Management of these infections often is 
complicated by limited vascular access options, as well as an increasing 
prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria in hemodialysis centers, including the 
emergence of strains of methicillin-resistant S aureus with vancomycin 
heteroresistance and increasing rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, both 
of which have limited antibiotic treatment options. This article describes the 
management of these infections based on the organism and its susceptibility 
profile, including catheter management, antibiotic lock therapies, and systemic 
antibiotic choices. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia often 
may be managed with preservation of the catheter, antibiotic lock therapy, and 
intravenous antibiotics, this is rarely the case with S aureus bacteremia 
because of frequent relapse and the risk of complications, including 
endocarditis. Enterococcal bacteremia requires more individualization of care, 
but catheters are less likely to be salvaged, especially when 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus is the causative organism. Finally, strong 
infection control policies in the hemodialysis unit, conversion from catheter to 
arteriovenous access when possible, and appropriate use of antibiotics are 
essential factors in the prevention of these bloodstream infections.

We describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of invasive 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with vancomycin 
MICs of 2 μg/ml and compare heteroresistant-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) to 
non-hVISA. Health care-associated community-onset infections were the most 
common and resulted in frequent complications and relapses. hVISA-infected 
patients were more likely to have been hospitalized in the year prior to MRSA 
culture.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the recent epidemiology of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in a UK tertiary referral center.
METHODS: We collected epidemiological and laboratory data on all cases of MRSA 
bacteremia from September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007.
RESULTS: There were 195 clinically significant episodes. Most were 
hospital-acquired. Only one episode occurred in patients without a history of 
hospital admission in the previous 12 months. An intravascular device was the 
most common focus of infection (37%), with no identifiable source found in 35% 
of episodes. Twenty-eight percent of patients died within 30 days of bacteremia. 
Mortality was significantly higher in the absence of an identifiable focus. 
Failure to include an antibiotic active against MRSA in the empirical treatment 
was only significantly associated with death in patients showing signs of 
hemodynamic instability (p < 0.001). No isolates had a minimum inhibitory 
concentration to vancomycin above 1.5mg/l and no heteroresistance to 
glycopeptide antibiotics (heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus 
aureus; hVISA) was detected. All isolates were sensitive to daptomycin, 
tigecycline, and linezolid.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in infection control measures, medical devices 
remain the most common source of infection. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic 
usage is associated with a poor outcome in patients with signs of severe sepsis. 
Susceptibility to glycopeptides and newer antibiotics remains good.

BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading 
cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP), and health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). These infections are 
associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The impact of 
vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on mortality for patients with 
MRSA pneumonia has not been determined.
METHODS: Adult patients in ICUs with a diagnosis of MRSA HAP, VAP, or HCAP were 
entered in the study. Clinical and laboratory information were prospectively 
collected. Vancomycin MIC and heteroresistance were determined for each MRSA 
isolate. Data were collected from February 2006 through August 2007. The primary 
outcome variable was all-cause mortality at day 28. A propensity score approach 
was used to adjust for confounding variables.
RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 158 patients. All-cause mortality at day 
28 was 32.3%. The majority of MRSA isolates had a vancomycin MIC ≥ 1.5 mg/mL 
(115/158, 72.8%). Propensity score analysis demonstrated an increase in 28-day 
mortality as vancomycin MIC increased from 0.75 to 3 mg/mL (P ≤ .001). 
Heteroresistance to vancomycin, demonstrated in 21.5% isolates, was not 
associated with mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in patients with MRSA HAP, VAP, and HCAP increases as a 
function of the vancomycin MIC, even for strains with MIC values within the 
susceptible range. Evaluation of vancomycin MICs should be contemplated at the 
institutional level and for individual cases of MRSA pneumonia. The use of 
vancomycin therapy in patients with MRSA pneumonia caused by isolates with MICs 
between 1 and 2 mg/mL should be undertaken with caution, and alternative 
therapies should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case in which daptomycin-nonsusceptible 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia was successfully 
treated with the addition of rifampin to daptomycin.
CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old male presented with fever and chills following 
cystoscopy. After culturing was conducted, the patient received single doses of 
vancomycin and gentamicin and then continued on vancomycin plus ceftazidime. 
Blood cultures grew MRSA, with vancomycin and daptomycin minimum inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) of < or =1 microg/mL and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. 
Vancomycin was continued, with trough concentrations maintained >15 microg/mL, 
but results of blood cultures remained positive. On day 10, therapy was switched 
to daptomycin 6 mg/kg/day, but culture results remained positive. On day 13, 
testing for vancomycin heteroresistance was negative, with the MIC unchanged. 
The vancomycin MIC remained unchanged on day 19, but the daptomycin MIC had 
increased to 2 microg/mL. Rifampin 300 mg orally twice daily was added on day 
20; blood cultures obtained 2 days later were sterile. The patient was 
discharged to complete a 6-week course of antibiotics and was doing well 4 
months following therapy.
DISCUSSION: Analysis of MRSA isolates obtained on days 1 and 19 showed an 
increase in the daptomycin MIC from 0.25 to 2 microg/mL. Because intervening 
isolates were not available for susceptibility testing, it is not possible to 
associate this increase with exposure to either vancomycin or daptomycin. 
Although in vitro synergy was not seen in this case, addition of rifampin to 
daptomycin therapy resolved the bacteremia.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia, isolates should be 
retested for susceptibility to both daptomycin and vancomycin, including 
assessment for vancomycin heteroresistance. Addition of rifampin to daptomycin 
may be effective for persistent MRSA bacteremia, even if daptomycin MICs are 
elevated. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of combination 
therapy.

OBJECTIVES: Infections caused by heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate 
Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) are associated with high rates of vancomycin 
treatment failure. Telavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide active in vitro 
against Gram-positive pathogens including hVISA and vancomycin-intermediate S. 
aureus (VISA). This study characterizes the microbiological activity of 
telavancin against vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA), hVISA and VISA 
strains.
METHODS: Reference strains of VSSA, hVISA and VISA were assessed for potential 
telavancin heteroresistance by population analysis. In addition, the efficacies 
of telavancin (40 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h for 4 days) and vancomycin 
(110 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h for 8 days) were compared in a neutropenic 
murine model (immunocompromised female non-Swiss albino mice) of bacteraemia 
caused by hVISA strain Mu3. Blood and spleen bacterial titres were quantified 
from cohorts of mice euthanized pre-treatment and at 24 h intervals 
post-treatment for 8 days.
RESULTS: Telavancin was active against all strains of S. aureus tested, with MIC 
values < or =0.5 mg/L. Population analyses revealed no evidence of 
subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to telavancin. In the murine 
bacteraemia model of hVISA infection, all animals were bacteraemic pre-treatment 
and mortality was 100% within 16-24 h post-infection in untreated animals. 
Treatment with telavancin was associated with lower spleen bacterial titres, 
lower rates of bacteraemia and lower overall mortality than treatment with 
vancomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and pre-clinical in vivo studies demonstrate that 
telavancin has the potential to be efficacious in infections caused by hVISA.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity: grave concern or death by character 
assassination?

Hazlewood KA(1), Brouse SD, Pitcher WD, Hall RG.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was reported in 0% to 5% of patients in the 
1980s. This has been confirmed by numerous clinical trials comparing novel 
anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents with vancomycin at the 
Food and Drug Administration-approved dosage of 1 g every 12 hours. Treatment 
failures of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
infections have been reported despite in vitro susceptibility. These failures 
have led to the use of vancomycin doses higher than those approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration. Higher doses are being administered to achieve goal 
vancomycin trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL recommended by several 
clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of 
America. Recent studies suggest that increased rates of nephrotoxicity are 
associated with aggressive vancomycin dosing. These increased rates are 
confounded by concomitant nephrotoxins, renal insufficiency, or changing 
hemodynamics. These studies also have demonstrated that vancomycin's 
nephrotoxicity risk is minimal in patients without risk factors for 
nephrotoxicity. Clinicians unwilling to dose vancomycin in accordance with 
clinical practice guidelines should use an alternative agent because inadequate 
dosing increases the likelihood of selecting heteroresistant 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and microbiological outcomes of linezolid 
versus vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
complicated skin and soft-tissue infection (cSSTI) using a meta-analysis.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical trials were identified using PubMed, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the International 
Pharmaceutical Abstracts from inception to March 2009. Primary outcomes 
evaluated resolution of signs and symptoms of infection in clinically evaluable 
(CE) patients, and microbiological eradication in both the modified 
intent-to-treat (MITT) and MRSA evaluable (MRSA ME) patients. MITT patients had 
a culture-confirmed Gram-positive pathogen (S. aureus) at baseline. Secondary 
outcomes included mortality, adverse drug reactions (ADR), and discontinuation 
due to ADRs. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were calculated using the fixed effects model based on the assumption that 
there was little to no heterogeneity between the studies in the primary 
analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed for each outcome by removing the 
most weighted study.
RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 2652 patients (1361/linezolid; 
1291/vancomycin) were identified. Resolution of infection in CE patients (OR = 
1.41; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.95) and MITT patients (OR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.33, 2.76) 
favored the use of linezolid over vancomycin, but did not remain significant 
after sensitivity analyses (CE: OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 0.81, 2.05; MITT: OR = 1.73; 
95% CI: 0.87, 3.41). Microbiological eradication in MRSA ME patients 
consistently favored the use of linezolid over vancomycin (OR = 2.90; 95% CI: 
1.90, 4.41). No difference in mortality was observed between the two groups (OR 
= 1.17; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.62). Higher proportions of linezolid patients were found 
to have diarrhea (119/1361 vs. 52/1291), nausea (102/1361 vs. 46/1291) and 
thrombocytopenia (54/1121 vs. 8/1071), whereas a higher proportion of vancomycin 
patients were found to have renal insufficiency compared to linezolid (16/634 
vs. 4/703). Inconsistent results were seen with the incidence of anemia and rash 
between the base-case (anemia: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.08; rash: OR = 0.26; 
95% CI: 0.10, 0.68) and sensitivity analyses (anemia: OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.24, 
4.37; rash: OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.12, 2.71). Discontinuation due to ADRs was not 
statistically different between linezolid and vancomycin (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 
0.75, 1.51).
CONCLUSION: Resolution of infection in CE and MITT patients were inconsistent; 
however, a sub-analysis revealed that linezolid was more likely to consistently 
achieve microbiologic eradication in MRSA ME patients. Apparent risks of 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, diarrhea, and possibly anemia may limit linezolid use 
in treating MRSA cSSTI. This study was limited due to an inability to assess for 
the effects of hetero-resistance and appropriate vancomycin dosing on outcomes. 
Moreover, the small number of studies made controlling for heterogeneity 
challenging.

We report a case of recurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a patient who 
failed vancomycin due to a vancomycin-heteroresistant strain lacking methicillin 
resistance. Although initial isolates were susceptible, isolates obtained after 
vancomycin chemotherapy were vancomycin heteroresistant. This case thus 
illustrates the clinical emergence of vancomycin heteroresistance.

This retrospective case-control study was undertaken to review the clinical 
features associated with heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus 
aureus (hVISA) and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) infections and the 
local impact they have on clinical outcome. Compared with vancomycin-susceptible 
S. aureus (n = 30), hVISA and VISA infections (n = 10) are found to be 
associated with a longer period of prior glycopeptide use (P = 0.01), bone/joint 
(P < 0.01) and prosthetic infections (P = 0.04), as well as treatment failure, 
as evidenced by longer bacteremic (P < 0.01) and culture positivity (P < 0.01) 
periods. This was observed to have resulted in longer hospital length of stay (P 
< 0.01) and total antibiotic therapy duration (P = 0.01). There was, however, no 
significant difference in the overall patient mortality or the hospitalization 
cost (P = 0.12) in both groups. Clinicians should be cognizant of the 
association between hVISA/VISA with high bacterial load deep-seated infections. 
We recommend targeted and even universal screening for hVISA/VISA in 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections.

Vancomycin MICs (V-MIC) and the frequency of heteroresistant 
vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) isolates are increasing 
among methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, 
but their relevance remains uncertain. We compared the V-MIC (Etest) and the 
frequency of hVISA (Etest macromethod) for all MRSA blood isolates saved over an 
11-year span and correlated the results with the clinical outcome. We tested 489 
isolates: 61, 55, 187, and 186 isolates recovered in 1996-1997, 2000, 2002-2003, 
and 2005-2006, respectively. The V-MICs were < or = 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 microg/ml 
for 74 (15.1%), 355 (72.6%), 50 (10.2%), and 10 (2.1%) isolates, respectively. 
We detected hVISA in 0/74, 48/355 (13.5%), 15/50 (30.0%), and 8/10 (80.0%) 
isolates with V-MICs of < or = 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 microg/ml, respectively (P < 
0.001). The V-MIC distribution and the hVISA frequency were stable over the 
11-year period. Most patients (89.0%) received vancomycin. The mortality rate 
(evaluated with 285 patients for whose isolates the trough V-MIC was > or = 10 
microg/ml) was comparable for patients whose isolates had V-MICs of < or = 1 and 
1.5 microg/ml (19.4% and 27.0%, respectively; P = 0.2) but higher for patients 
whose isolates had V-MICs of > or = 2 microg/ml (47.6%; P = 0.03). However, the 
impact of V-MIC and hVISA status on mortality or persistent (> or = 7 days) 
bacteremia was not substantiated by multivariate analysis. Staphylococcal 
chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) typing of 261 isolates (including all hVISA 
isolates) revealed that 93.0% of the hVISA isolates were SCCmec type II. These 
findings demonstrate that the V-MIC distribution and hVISA frequencies were 
stable over an 11-year span. A V-MIC of > or = 2 microg/ml was associated with a 
higher rate of mortality by univariate analysis, but the relevance of the V-MIC 
and the presence of hVISA remain uncertain. A multicenter prospective randomized 
study by the use of standardized methods is needed to evaluate the relevance of 
hVISA and determine the optimal treatment of patients whose isolates have V-MICs 
of > or = 2.0 microg/ml.

We investigated associations between the genotypic and phenotypic features of 
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream isolates and the clinical characteristics of 
bacteremic patients enrolled in a phase III trial of S. aureus bacteremia and 
endocarditis. Isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PCR for 33 
putative virulence genes, and screening for heteroresistant glycopeptide 
intermediate S. aureus (hGISA). A total of 230 isolates (141 
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and 89 methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) 
were analyzed. North American and European S. aureus isolates differed in their 
genotypic characteristics. Overall, 26% of the MRSA bloodstream isolates were 
USA 300 strains. Patients with USA 300 MRSA bacteremia were more likely to be 
injection drug users (61% versus 15%; P < 0.001), to have right-sided 
endocarditis (39% versus 9%; P = 0.002), and to be cured of right-sided 
endocarditis (100% versus 33%; P = 0.01) than patients with non-USA 300 MRSA 
bacteremia. Patients with persistent bacteremia were less likely to be infected 
with Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene (pvl)-constitutive MRSA (19% versus 56%; P 
= 0.005). Although 7 of 89 MRSA isolates (8%) exhibited the hGISA phenotype, no 
association with persistent bacteremia, daptomycin resistance, or bacterial 
genotype was observed. This study suggests that the virulence gene profiles of 
S. aureus bloodstream isolates from North America and Europe differ 
significantly. In this study of bloodstream isolates collected as part of a 
multinational randomized clinical trial, USA 300 and pvl-constitutive MRSA 
strains were associated with better clinical outcomes.

A patient with native valve endocarditis caused by a vancomycin 
"heteroresistant" strain of Enterococcus faecium experienced failure of 
daptomycin monotherapy without evidence of daptomycin resistance. The infecting 
organism exhibited in vivo emergence of a vancomycin-susceptible subpopulation 
lacking vanA. Treatment with a combination of high-dose daptomycin, gentamicin, 
and high-dose ampicillin cleared the infection.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate microbiological properties of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) during prolonged vancomycin therapy.
METHODS: We evaluated vancomycin susceptibility and heteroresistance, accessory 
gene regulator (agr) function, autolysis, biofilm production and in vitro 
vancomycin killing in serial MRSA bloodstream isolates obtained over a 30 month 
period from a patient with a chronic endovascular infection.
RESULTS: Despite the fact that the MRSA in this patient had the same genetic 
background as other clinical glycopeptide intermediate-resistant S. aureus 
(GISA) isolates, vancomycin administered for 9 months, maintaining serum 
concentrations >10 mg/L, did not select for GISA. Minimal changes in vancomycin 
susceptibility were detected using agar dilution and population analysis 
methods. We noted increases in delta haemolysin production, autolysis and the 
bactericidal effects of vancomycin in vitro against the MRSA obtained after 
prolonged vancomycin suppressive therapy was discontinued.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of development of detectable resistance, MRSA 
exposed to vancomycin for prolonged periods may begin to develop vancomycin 
tolerance and decreased autolysis. In addition, suppression of agr function 
appears to end after vancomycin is stopped. Whether these changes are 
prerequisites for attenuated vancomycin efficacy and the development of 
glycopeptide resistance warrants further study. The development of vancomycin 
resistance may be more difficult under conditions where vancomycin serum 
concentrations are maintained >10 mg/L.

We describe a case of clinical failure of vancomycin treatment of Staphylococcus 
aureus infection and the laboratory characteristics of the organism in a 
tertiary referral university hospital in southern Brazil. An 11-month-old male 
patient presented with pneumonia and S. aureus was isolated from his respiratory 
tract. Initial treatment with oxacillin and gentamicin was ineffective. 
Vancomycin was added to the regimen as the patient worsened, but after the 
30(th) day of vancomycin treatment S. aureus was isolated from the blood. This 
isolate had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for vancomycin of 4 mg/mL. 
After pre-incubation with vancomycin the isolate displayed an increase in the 
expression of vancomycin resistance and colonies grew in the presence of up to 
12 mg/mL vancomycin. Based on these results, and considering that the patient 
had not responded to vancomycin, the isolate was considered to be S. aureus 
heteroresistant to vancomycin (SAHV). The SAHV proved to be similar, based on 
DNA macrorestriction analysis, to methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) 
isolates from other patients in the hospital who had responded to vancomycin 
treatment. Our findings underline the need to improve methods in the clinical 
laboratory to detect the emergence of S. aureus clinically resistant to 
vancomycin. The fact that the isolate emerged in the blood 30 days after 
vancomycin treatment was initiated suggests that the organism was originally an 
MRSA that had acquired the ability to circumvent the mechanism of action of 
vancomycin.

We report the first instance in Australia of treatment failure due to a strain 
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with reduced 
susceptibility to vancomycin--heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus 
(hVISA). The infection occurred in a 41-year-old man with multiple risk factors. 
No transmission of the organism to other patients or the environment was 
detected. This case may herald the beginning of a new phase of staphylococcal 
resistance in Australia.
