# IPC Genomics Research Positioning

## Key Findings from IPC Operations Research

### Current IPC Team Activities
- Daily: lab data review, unit rounding, clinical consultations
- Weekly: surveillance reports, high-risk area rounds, reportable disease submission
- Monthly: committee meetings, infection data analysis, policy reviews
- Annual: risk assessments, infection prevention plans

### Genomics Gap in IPC Practice
**Evidence for genomics value:**
- 25% of HAI transmission events missed without WGS
- Traditional epidemiology often wrong about transmission links
- UK sequenced >1M pathogen genomes; US invested $22M in genomics centers
- University of Pittsburgh EDS-HAT: weekly WGS detected 172 outbreaks, 95% stopped after intervention

**Current barriers to adoption:**
- 7-10 day turnaround time (vs 48h possible)
- Lack of bioinformatics expertise in hospitals
- $100K+ infrastructure costs
- Interpretation complexity (SNP thresholds, phylogenetics)

**Most hospitals still rely on traditional phenotypic methods**

## Dr Jessica Schults' NHMRC Grants (2025)

### Grant 1: #REBUILD (ID: 2040733)
- $999,041 funding
- Focus: learning health systems approach to reduce HAI burden
- Partnership with Queensland Health + patients
- Develops knowledge translation solutions for IPC programs

### Grant 2: EL1 (ID: 2040904)
- $688,405 funding
- Similar focus on evidence translation for HAI prevention
- State-of-the-art systems for IPC programs

**Gap identified:** No genomics/bioinformatics component in either grant

## Proposed Positioning

### Core concept
**"Integrating genomic surveillance into learning health systems for IPC"**

### Complementarity with Schults
- **Her strength:** IPC learning health systems infrastructure, knowledge translation pathways
- **Your strength:** Genomic surveillance, bioinformatics, transmission detection
- **Synergy:** Her system needs accurate data; your genomics needs implementation pathways

### Value proposition
- Traditional surveillance (her current data source) misses 25% of transmission
- Genomic surveillance provides precise transmission detection
- Combined approach: genomic data → learning health system → translated into practice change

## Critical Question to Answer
**Is anyone already doing genomic HAI surveillance in Queensland/Australia?**
- Need to verify this is genuinely open space vs. competing with existing work
- If open: strong positioning opportunity
- If occupied: need different angle
